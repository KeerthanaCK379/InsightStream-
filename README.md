# 🌟 NM Project

The **NM Project** is my first step into building and publishing code on GitHub 🚀.  
It’s designed to showcase my learning journey in Computer Science while experimenting with coding, version control, and open-source practices.  

This repository is part of my academic and personal growth as a **B.Sc. Computer Science student** at Chevalier T. Thomas Elizabeth College.
